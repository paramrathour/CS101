These are \textbf{optional} problems.
As these problems are pretty involving, my advice to you would be to first solve exercises given in slides and get comfortable with the course content.
The taught methods will suffice to solve these problems. (You are free to use `other' stuff but not recommended)

	\textbf{Good Programming Practices}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Clearly writing documentation explaining what the program does, how to use it, what quantities it takes as input, and what quantities it returns as output.
\item
Using appropriate variable/function names.
\item 
Extensive internal comments explaining how the program works.
\item 
Complete error handling with informative error messages.\\
For example, if $a = b = 0$, then the $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)$ routine should return the error message ``$\operatorname{gcd}(0,0)$ is undefined'' instead of going into an infinite loop or returning a ``division by zero'' error.
\end{itemize}
